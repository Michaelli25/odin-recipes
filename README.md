This Project was created as part of 'The Odin Project' cirriculum, found @ https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes. \
I learned more about how to produce a webpage utilizing HTML by building a main page as well as 3 subpages for beef broccoli, pho, and chicken katsu recipes.
